As of OSS release 1.0, there are only two steps are required to make it possible to build with mono in the source repo:

- apply ReactiveAssert.cs change.
- run replacer.sh 

Actually ObservableExTest.cs cannot be compiled due to insufficient
type inference for lambdas, so I skipped it in Mono.Reactive.Testing_test.dll.
